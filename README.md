# ⚡ SecureGrid – AI-Powered Cybersecurity for Power Grids

**Author:** Jejo J

## 📌 Problem Statement

Power grids are the backbone of modern civilization — but they’re increasingly targeted by sophisticated cyberattacks.
From ransomware to malware-injected IoT devices, these threats can cause **massive blackouts, economic losses, and public safety hazards**.

### ⚠️ Notable Real-World Incidents:

* **Ukraine Power Grid Attack (2015)** – Hackers remotely disabled substations, causing a blackout for **230,000 people**.
* **Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack (2021)** – Disrupted fuel supply across the U.S. East Coast, costing billions.
* **Indian Power Grid Incident (2020)** – Suspected cyberattack linked to malware targeting grid control systems.
* **Brazil Blackout (2007)** – Allegedly caused by cyber intrusions, affecting millions.

These attacks prove one thing: **critical infrastructure needs next-level security**.

## 💡 About SecureGrid

**SecureGrid** is an **AI-driven cybersecurity framework** designed to protect **smart grids and critical power infrastructure** from cyber threats.

It combines:

* **Anomaly Detection** – AI models to spot unusual grid activity.
* **Automated Response** – Isolating compromised nodes instantly.
* **Blockchain Logging** – Tamper-proof event storage for transparency.
* **Simulation Mode** – Test the system without a real grid connection.
